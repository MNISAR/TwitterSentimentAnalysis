 A small app to get people's opinion about some trends.

1. Login into your twitter account.
2. go to https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps

4. It will ask for some details like Name, Purpose, etc.. Fill those and create the app
5. Now navigate to "Detail" of the app you just created. and then go to "Keys and token" panel. There you will see Consumer API keys. (we will be using these as well as the keys generated in next step)
6. Next step is to generate the access tokens and access secret. So click on generate Access token
7. Now you have your keys and secret. Cply them in your program and you will be good to go.
